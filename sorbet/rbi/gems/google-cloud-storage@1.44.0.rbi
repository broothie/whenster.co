# # Google Cloud
#
# The google-cloud library is the official library for interacting with Google
# Cloud Platform. Google Cloud Platform is a set of modular cloud-based services
# that allow you to create anything from simple websites to complex
# applications.
#
# The goal of google-cloud is to provide an API that is comfortable to
# Rubyists. Your authentication credentials are detected automatically in
# Google Cloud Platform environments such as Google Compute Engine, Google
# App Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine. In other environments you can
# configure authentication easily, either directly in your code or via
# environment variables. Read more about the options for connecting in the
# {file:AUTHENTICATION.md Authentication Guide}.

module Google::Cloud
  # Creates a new object for connecting to the Storage service.
  # Each call creates a new connection.
  #
  # For more information on connecting to Google Cloud see the
  # {file:AUTHENTICATION.md Authentication Guide}.
  #
  # @example The default scope can be overridden with the `scope` option:
  #   require "google/cloud"
  #
  #   gcloud  = Google::Cloud.new
  #   readonly_scope = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only"
  #   readonly_storage = gcloud.storage scope: readonly_scope
  # @example
  #   require "google/cloud"
  #
  #   gcloud  = Google::Cloud.new
  #   storage = gcloud.storage
  #   bucket = storage.bucket "my-bucket"
  #   file = bucket.file "path/to/my-file.ext"
  # @param retries [Integer] Number of times to retry requests on server
  #   error. The default value is `3`. Optional.
  # @param max_elapsed_time [Integer] Total time in seconds that requests are allowed to keep being retried.
  # @param base_interval [Float] The initial interval in seconds between tries.
  # @param max_interval [Integer] The maximum interval in seconds that any individual retry can reach.
  # @param timeout [Integer] (default timeout) The max duration, in seconds, to wait before timing out. Optional.
  #   If left blank, the wait will be at most the time permitted by the underlying HTTP/RPC protocol.
  # @param open_timeout [Integer] How long, in seconds, before failed connections time out. Optional.
  # @param read_timeout [Integer] How long, in seconds, before requests time out. Optional.
  # @param send_timeout [Integer] How long, in seconds, before receiving response from server times out. Optional.
  # @param multiplier [Integer] Each successive interval grows by this factor. A multipler of 1.5 means the next
  #   interval will be 1.5x the current interval.
  # @param scope [String, Array<String>] The OAuth 2.0 scopes controlling the
  #   set of resources and operations that the connection can access. See
  #   [Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google
  #   APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).
